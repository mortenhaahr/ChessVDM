# ChessVDM

Author: Morten Haahr Kristensen

This VDM model was developed by Morten Haahr Kristensen. A complementary paper was submitted for the OVT-21 conference. The purpose of the model is to serve as an educational example of how Chess can be modelled in VDM. It is modelled using a functional style and only using immutable types (except for `Runner`.) It has been tested using a variety of testing techniques.
